						In Alsace, near Germany, you’ll find Baeckeoffe (a slow-cooked meat
						and potato stew) and foie gras, served with sweet Alsatian white

						<br />
						In Burgundy, the star is turkey with chestnuts and dishes cooked
						with local wine, like boeuf bourguignon.
						<br />
						Along the coast in Brittany and Provence, seafood rules: oysters,
						scallops (Saint-Jacques), mussels and sometimes a full seafood
						tower.
						<br />A sweet classic across all France is Bûche de Noël — a
						Christmas log cake shaped like a piece of firewood.
						<br />
						This tradition comes from old rural customs where families burned
						huge logs during winter to bring luck and warmth.
						<br />
						Fun fact: in some families, the Christmas dinner can last up to 6
						hours with more than 7 courses. French Christmas food is not just
						about eating — it’s about sharing time, memory and warmth.

							From knife handling and sautéing to understanding heat levels and
							seasoning properly, mastering basics changes everything. One key
							concept is “mise en place”: preparing everything before cooking.
						</p>

						<ol className="article-full-text">
							<li>
								How to hold a knife properly – safer, faster, more precise.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								Sautéing – cooking quickly in a pan with little fat, great for
								vegetables.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								Boiling vs simmering – boiling = high heat bubbles, simmering =
								gentle heat. Big difference.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								Deglazing a pan – adding liquid (water, wine, broth) to dissolve
								flavors stuck to the bottom.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>Taste as you cook – your tongue is your best tool.</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								Using salt correctly – salt enhances flavor, it doesn’t just
								make food salty.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								Resting meat – let it rest after cooking so juices redistribute.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>Understanding heat levels – high heat ≠ better cooking.</li>
							<br />
							<li>
								Reading a recipe fully before starting – it avoids 80% of
								beginner mistakes.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li>Mise en place – preparing all ingredients before cooking.</li>
						</ol>

						<p className="article-full-text">
							<strong>Term explained:</strong>
							<br />
							Mise en place (French) means &quot;everything in its place&quot;.
							<br />
							It’s a key principle in professional kitchens.
